From a certain start situation, each raster-cell can die or come to life depending on their surroundings.

At the end of the tutorial the spatial algorithm will output a new end_state. Download the start_state.tif (### add link ###). Open QGIS, open the Python console in QGIS (ctrl + alt + p), set your working directory and load the raster into QGIS."
